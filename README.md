# Which-College-to-Go
### Topic
Which college in the United States offers you the best chance to climb up the ladder?

### Motivation
This map is a map of opportunity. 
It answers the question using data for over 30 million college students from 1999-2013.
The map offers you the insight of the median income and intergenerational mobility at each college in the United States [(Raj Chetty et al. 2017)](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf).

### Data Descriptions

#### 1. Parental income
We measure parental income as the average annual household total income before taxes and transfers (defined as Adjusted Gross Income) and adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars over the five years when the child turned 15-19. 

#### 2. Child income
We define child income as individual labor earnings (sum of wage and self- employment earnings) in 2014. 

#### 3. Percentile ranks
We define percentile ranks by ranking them based on their earnings relative to others in their birth cohort. 

#### 4. Estimated income median and mobility rate
Following established disclosure standards, we report estimates rather than exact values of the statistics for each college in this interactive map. The estimates are quite accurate: the estimation error is comparable to the fluctuation in the true statistics across years for a typical college that arises due to sampling error.
