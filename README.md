# Which-College-to-Go
### Topic
Which college in the United States offers you the best chance to achieve the American Dream?

### Motivation
This map is a map of opportunity. 
It answers this question using data for over 30 million college students from 1999-2013.
The map offers you insight of the median income and intergenerational mobility at each college in the United States (Raj Chetty et al. 2017).

### Data Descriptions

#### parental income
We measure parental income as the average annual household total income before taxes and transfers (defined as Adjusted Gross Income) and adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars over the five years when the child turned 15-19. 

#### child income
We define child income as individual labor earnings (sum of wage and self- employment earnings) in 2014. 

#### children’s percentile ranks
We define children’s percentile ranks by ranking them based on their earnings relative to others in their birth cohort. 

#### parents’ percentile ranks
Similarly, we define parents’ percentile ranks by ranking them based on their incomes relative to other parents with children in the same birth cohort.

### Estimates
Following established disclosure standards, we report estimates rather than exact values of the statistics for each college in this interactive map. The estimates are quite accurate: the estimation error is comparable to the fluctuation in the true statistics across years for a typical college that arises due to sampling error.
